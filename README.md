# Project Paging Doctor Document

Welcome to the digital waiting room where SQL migrations and documentation meet. This repository provides a toolkit for tracking database projects on Monday.com, complete with a ready-to-import board and a script that generates a parade of tasks.

## What's in the bag?

- **monday_template/** – files to kick-start a Monday.com board for SQL migrations.
  - `SQL_Migration_Tasks.csv` – sample tasks you can import directly.
  - `Generate_Task_List.ps1` – a PowerShell helper for conjuring an even bigger task list.

For detailed steps and a dash of whimsy, wander over to the [monday_template](./monday_template/README.md) folder.

Happy migrating!
